1. The first step in any of these is making sure that you have the correct formatting of both the codebook and the datasets. 
    - Right now I have loaded example data from the TIMCI Senegal Data, which I am loading below 
    - This data should be in a .csv file format.  

``` {python}
import pandas as pd

codebook_file_path = "/Users/clairelichty/summer2023/SwissTPH/SwissTPH-drug-classification/combined_01a-TIMCI-CRF-Facility-Senegal-form_codebook.xlsx - Code Sheet.csv"
raw_data = "/Users/clairelichty/summer2023/SwissTPH/SwissTPH-drug-classification/02_timci_day0_data.csv"

codebook_dataframe = pd.read_csv(codebook_file_path)
raw_dataframe = pd.read_csv(raw_data)
```

2. Looking at the codebook, we can see that is it in the format that is specified in the ReadMe file. 

```{python}
codebook_dataframe
```

3. The next step is to run main function, which should prompt you asking for the file paths 
```
